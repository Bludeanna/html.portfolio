<h1>The Best Movies According To Jade</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Pearl</h3>
<p>Its a well thought out movie in my opinion, it shows the horrifying effect of isolation 
    and the psychopathic tendencies that come with it. I loved the pacing and the overall premise of the movie. The build up was really good and I get chills everytime i get reminded of this masterpiece of a prequel.

<h3>Ponyo</h3>
<P>Its a very comforting movie that has amazing visuals and animation. It really made me resonate with the characters, and the use of the ocean's presence is a relaxing element. Its a funny, slice of life, heartfelt and sweet fantasy movie that will always have a place in my heart.</P>

<h3>Black Swan</h3>
<p>This movie discusses the painful ubringing of perfectionism. I really loved the articulation and pacing of the whole movie. I also loved how it expresses the insanity of the situation and its characters. It shows how such an elegant and gentle piece of art can make you go insane with the pressure of being perfect.</p>
